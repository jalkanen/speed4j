* Much improved memory management: The StopWatch queue size has now a maximum limit
  (to prevent a case where a producer would just keep sending stuff that we couldn't
  process fast enough).  Also, the StopWatch queues are now emptied as quickly
  as possible. 
  
* Added new internal JMX attribute: "DroppedStopWatches" to monitor StopWatches
  which are dropped when they can't fit in the queue.
  
* There's another new internal JMX attribute: "StopWatchQueueLength" which you
  can use to directly monitor whether Speed4j is keeping up with the incoming
  events.

* You can now shut up the PeriodicalLog logging by simply setting the slf4jLogName
  to an empty string.

* PeriodicalLog now requires Java 6 for j.u.c.LinkedBlockingDeque.  Speed4j can
  only be used on Java 5 VM if PeriodicalLog is not used.
