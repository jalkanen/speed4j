This is Speed4j, a very simple (but fast) Java performance analysis library. It is
designed using Perf4j as a model, but hopefully avoiding the pitfalls inherent
in Perf4j's design.  Also, Perf4j does not seem to be seeing a lot of development
these days...

Speed4j has a dependency on SLF4J (see http://slf4j.org), which it uses to log
its workings, but no other dependencies.

This is alpha quality code, caveat emptor.

Anyhoo, while you're waiting for better javadocs, here's the gist of the usage.

SIMPLEST POSSIBLE
=================

public void myBusyMethod()
{
	StopWatch sw = new StopWatch();
	
	// Do the busy thing
	
	sw.stop();
	System.out.println(sw);
}

This would simply print out how fast the block was.  Very useful for quick performance
testing.  Also, you could do

GETTING ITERATIONS TOO
======================

public void myBusyMethod()
{
	StopWatch sw = new StopWatch();
	
	int iterations = 1000;
	
	for( int i = 0; i < iterations; i++ ) {
		// Do the busy thing
	}
	
	sw.stop();
	
	System.out.println(sw.toString(iterations));
}

This would print out how fast the block was, *and* how many times the iterated
block would execute per second.

However, speed4j is designed to be a part of your application.  So we could
also do the following:

A COMPLEX EXAMPLE
=================

public void myBusyMethod2()
{
	StopWatch sw = myStopWatchFactory.getStopWatch();
	
	try
	{
		// Do the busy thing

		// Notice that sw.stop() automatically logs if the Factory is configured so		
		sw.stop("busyThing:success");
	}
	finally
	{
		sw.stop("busything:failure");
	}
}

Wait, where did the "myStopWatchFactory" come from?  Well, you initialized it somewhere
in your app or class with

StopWatchFactory myStopWatchFactory = StopWatchFactory.getInstance("loggingFactory");

This is where it gets interesting.  Speed4j will read the configuration for the factory
named in the call (in this case, "loggingFactory") from a file called "speed4j.properties"
from your class path.  Let's see how a sample file would look like:

SPEED4J.PROPERTIES
=================

   speed4j.loggingFactory=com.ecyrd.speed4j.log.Slf4jLog
   speed4j.loggingFactory.slf4jLogname=com.example.mylog

So, this defines a Log called "loggingFactory" which uses the "com.ecyrd.speed4j.log.Slf4jLog"
instance to do the logging.  This particular class would connect to the given SLF4J logger
and log using the info() method to it.  So depending your setup, this would then go to the
log4j or console or wherever.


PERIODICAL LOGGING
==================

If you are tired of manually looking at your log to figure out how fast something is, then
PeriodicalLog is your friend.

speed4j.loggingFactory=com.ecyrd.speed4j.log.PeriodicalLog
speed4j.loggingFactory.period=60
speed4j.loggingFactory.jmx=busything:success,busything:failure
speed4j.loggingFactory.slf4jLogname=com.example.myperiodicalllog

OK, lots of goodies happening here.  First you can set the period during which the stats
are collected, in this case 60 seconds.

Second, if the "jmx" attribute is set for a PeriodicalLog, it will expose a JMX management
bean which will list the average, standard deviation, count, min and max values for the given
tags.

Finally, it will also output a collected string to the given SLF4J logger, resulting into
something that looks like this:

PROGRAMMATIC CONFIGURATION
==========================

So property files ain't good for you?  You can also try the following:

public void myTest()
{
	PeriodicalLog myLog = new PeriodicalLog();
	myLog.setName("loggingFactory");
	myLog.setPeriod("60");
	myLog.setJmx("busything:success,busything:failure");
	myLog.setSlf4jLogname("com.example.myperiodicallog");
	
	StopWatchFactory swf = StopWatchFactory.getInstance(myLog);
	
	StopWatch sw = swf.getStopWatch();
	...
}

The properties are directly accessible also via the appropriate setters.  In fact,
all the speed4j configuration module does is that it just simply calls the appropriate
setter module - so if a property is called "speed4j.myLog.period=50" it will call
setPeriod("50") on myLog.  (In the future it will be smart enough to do the 
String->int conversion, promise).
