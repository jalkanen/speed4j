#  Define a new Log called "myLogger" which aggregates performance data every 60
#  seconds and both makes it available via JMX and logs it periodically to
#  the given slf4j logger.
#
#  You may use this logger by calling StopWatchFactory myFactory = StopWatchFactory.getInstance("myLogger");
#
#  Then all stopwatches returned by myFactory.getStopWatch() will log to myLogger.
